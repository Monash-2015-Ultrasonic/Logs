This is to evaluate the performance of each channel at detecting a calibrated distance against a flat surface, hence the logs return the flight times.
(To evaluate the overall system algorithm, refer to 3D logs to evaluate R)



These are the times returned after quadratic interpolation per channel.

The range is just (time * 49 / 78125) (which is time * 256/70000000 * 343 / 2)
